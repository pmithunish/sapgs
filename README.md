A Real-time Parking Guidance System developed with technologies like Google Maps, Angular 2, Ionic 2, Firebase &amp; Node.js consists of several Web Apps like Web based admin panel for the admin, Android/iOS app for the handlers, Android/iOS app for the users &amp; Server side micro service using Node. A user can book a parking slot using the mobile app and have to reach the parking spot to avoid auto cancellation. The Handler can see the real-time data of current bookings in their parking lot and can associate an open slot to a booked user if he/she makes it to the parking lot before auto cancellation. The Admin can add/remove/update a parking lot and can monitor the system and issue messages to a particular parking lot. The Server side micro service automatically cancels a booking request if the user doesn't make it to the parking lot.
